## ERHS 535 Homework 5

These maps show the locations of homicides in the Denver area that occured roughly between 2007 and 2017. Original dataset compiled by the Washington Post can be found at: https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides

I have mapped zipcode boundaries within Denver city limits to give a better idea in which areas of the city the homicides took place. I have included only points for the top three races in which homicides occured over this decade. One map shows cases that have been solved, while the other map shows unsolved cases.
